* SIGN MODE EXLCUSIVITY:

Expected: pressing the space bar throws the sign in the air.

Actual: pressing the space bar never does anything.

Description: The current intent is for the user to be able to press the
space bar and have the sign be tossed up into the air.
ISpinMode.isExclusive is used to determine if the current animation
prevents that from happening e.g. the sign is already up in the air.

It is expected that the normal mode of the player and sign is to be
standing still doing only a little bit of motion (to not look wooden
dead), and to allow the user to start a more active spin motion by
pressing the space bar.

Hence, PlayState.update() is checking for that keypress, but the Sign
never starts the Throw animation because the Flip animation never stops
and is exclusive.
