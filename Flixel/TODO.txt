+ sorry there's very inconsistent formatting in the code.
+ currently not getting sufficient resolution on audio channels to get good beat matching.
  + flixel is stuck on old versions of lime/openfl, dunno if they have fixed it since then.
+ implement nicer less hard coding of asset metdata (path, resolution, bpm).
+ right format per platform (ogg, mp3, wav, etc.).
  + can be done in Project.xml apparently.
+ all the "todo"'s in code.
