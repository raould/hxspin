FIXES

+ all the "todo"'s in code.

+ sorry there's very inconsistent formatting in the code.

+ currently not getting sufficient resolution on audio channels to get good beat matching.
  + flixel is stuck on old versions of lime/openfl, dunno if they have fixed it since then.

+ the physics is crap. as in, there isn't any.

+ implement nicer less hard coding of asset metdata (path, resolution, bpm).

+ right format per platform (ogg, mp3, wav, etc.).
  + can be done in Project.xml apparently.

+ software rotation is purportedly 10x slower than rotation via tilesheet frames.

+ animate the player, duh. also wrt the sign motion.

+ while i don't like having lots of things keeping references to each other e.g. the Sign vs. ISpinModes, since that can lead to painful memory debugging later, this *is* OOP code - so eff it.

IDEAS

+ might be funny to do a fake 3d spin around the head effect.
