========================================

+ see the ISSUES.txt file for "bug" reporting.

========================================

STYLE:

+ I do not like how Haxe properties work so I try to avoid using the Haxe getters and setters feature.

TODO FIXES:

+ all the "todo"'s in code.

+ nail down, codify which x,y is a corner, vs. a center, vs. whatever else.

+ backport the better audio time tracking from newer lime/openfl to flixel.

+ sucks-a-lot that apparently the "openfl run neko" type command can get confused about the sources vs. exported (compiled) files, and not be updating the output, so much so that now i always do "make clean run-neko".

+ sorry the haxe emacs modes are broken in various ways. i am using funda-haxe-mode which means i can't use apostrophes in comments!

+ sorry there's very inconsistent formatting in the code.

+ currently not getting sufficient resolution on audio channels to get good beat matching.
  + flixel is stuck on old versions of lime/openfl, dunno if they have fixed it since then.

+ implement loading hotspot metadata from image assets, so we can programatically get hand positions from artwork.

+ implement nicer less hard coding of asset metdata (path, resolution, bpm).

+ right format per platform (e.g. for music: ogg, mp3, wav, etc.).
  + can be done in Project.xml apparently.

+ software rotation is purportedly 10x slower than rotation via tilesheet frames.

+ animate the player, duh. also wrt the sign motion.

+ while i don't like having lots of things keeping references to each other e.g. the Sign vs. ISpinModes, since that can lead to painful memory debugging later, this *is* OOP code - so eff it.

========================================

IDEAS:

+ might be funny to do a fake 3d spin around the head effect.
